# Tread-Lightly
 A team PvP game about building tanks.

Detailed description:
You get money every round Counter Strike style and have to buy tank parts and build tanks to send into the field and win rounds.
Each player has a control chip which they must put into one tank before starting.
You can buy AI chips to put into other tanks you build but you get what you pay for.
Anything you bring into a round is at risk of being lost if the assosiated tank dies.
Ammo costs money and you can decide how much to put in a tank before round start (you can reload at your starting point but that would mean leaving the action and going all the way back, bringing all of the ammo could be bad if you die though).
Unused ammo and parts are stored.
The game will be teams of 2 by default and will have a limit on how many tanks can exist per team.
Some chassis can support upgrades such as a radar that lets you see through x amount of layers of wall
The chassis will decide max health, turret placement, upgrades, control chips, etc.
The turret will decide which bullets will work and how the tank shoots (or whatever it does)
The treads will decide movement.
There will also be a game mode/option where the tank limit is removed for fun.

Possible ideas:
Make parts degrade on taking damage, making them worse at their jobs (ex. a degraded chassis will have decreased max health). This would force players to either use old, crappy equipment to save money (like the real military), buy new stuff, or make expencive repairs to the tanks they want to keep. This would also stop players from putting all of their best stuff in one tank and becoming god.
